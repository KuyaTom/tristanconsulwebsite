            <h2>Tristan's Personality</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Tristan appears to most as a very mischievious, ambitious, creative, and
                easy-going.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>He makes a lot of jokes and is usually seen acting very playful
                and
                childish. He
                acts
                this way now as he used to be very shy and introverted. But, there is a lot more to him than meets the
                eye.

    <section class="persgrid2">
        <h2 class="item perssubtitle1 hidden">Mischievous / Jokey</h2>
        <p class="item persinfo2 hidden">Tristan often enjoys trolling his friends and sometimes his teachers. He acts
            very
            foolish and playful, but he can be serious if he chooses to or if absolutely necessary. More often than not
            he is
            seen cracking jokes and spitting out nonsense.</p>

            <h2>Ambitious</h2>
            <br>
            <p>This word literally means too much or to be extra. When faced with a task that he is
                dedicated to doing, Tristan will come up with the most ambitious plans prior to actually doing it. This often causes him to
                spend
                too much time ambitiously planning out his projects. There have been multiple instances where he has
                done
                this in various past high school projects. (View links below.)</p>

            <h2>Creative</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Because of how extra he can be, Tristan has a gift for generating a lot of imaginative
                as well as really dumb ideas. Ever since he was young he had always had a obession with building and
                creating. He once cut a katana out of wood on his own and carved his own chess pieces, etc.</p>

        <div class="item persinfo4 hidden">
            <p>Tristan has a very bad habit of procrastinating and being lazy. He enjoys
                taking
                extremely long breaks and chilling out as he is gets burned out and tired of doing tedious work very
                quickly.
                In fact he considered not including this part because he didn't feel like it and he had already spent
                too
                much time coding the content above. But alas he did it anyway. </p>
