        <div class="intinfo2 hidden">
            <p>Tristan loves baking. During the middle of 2020, his older sister (who knows how to bake) told him to
                bake some bread, because he wanted sandwiches and his family were out of bread. He reluctantly did it
                but after finishing it, he found that baking wasn't that difficult and he eventually turned it into a
                hobby.</p><br>
            <h4>He primarily bakes the following:</h4>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li class="hint">Bread</li>
                <li>Cookies</li>
                <li>Brownies</li>
                <li>Pretzels</li>
            </ol>

        <h1 class="intsubtitle2 hidden">Video Games</h1>
        <div class="intinfo3 hidden">
            <p>When he should instead be studying and productively doing school work and assignments, Tristan is often
                seen playing video games, on his computer.</p><br>
            <h4>He mostly enjoys playing:</h4>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Minecraft</li>
                <li>Red Dead Redemption II</li>
                <li>Fortnite</li>

        </div>
        <h1 class="intsubtitle3 hidden">Board Games</h1>
        <div class="intinfo4 hidden">
            <p>Tristan enjoys playing table top games with his family and sometimes friends. He doesn't play board games
                as often as video games, but he enjoys the feeling and thrill of it a lot more.</p><br>
            <h4>His favourite board games are:</h4>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Chess</li>

        <h1 class="intsubtitle4 hidden">Movies/TV Shows</h1>
        <div class="intinfo5 hidden">
            <p>When Tristan isn't doing anything above this section, he is watching a movie or a show. Tristan really
                enjoys pop-culture. He often makes many references to pop-culture, however, most of his
                friends dont understand them because they aren't as big of geeks as he is.</p><br>
            <h4>His favourite movie franchises are:</h4>

            <p>Tristan is a very tech savvy person. He likes dabbling with computers and keyboards mostly. Before he
                started university he built his first and current desktop computer, choosing all of the parts
                and setting up the software on it himself. He also built and modded his own mechanical keyboard.
                He has also taught himself how to repair iPhones and solder wires.</p><br>

            <p>Occasionally he will go outside and have some fun but not often. He does still enjoy the things that he
                will end up doing outdoors.</p><br>
