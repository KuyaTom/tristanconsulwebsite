            <p>Hello and thank you for visiting Tristan Consul's personal website.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Tristan was born at a very young age. At that moment in time he was briefly the youngest person on Earth.
                Fast forward 18 years later he is now currently 18 years old.</p>
            <br>
            <p>He is a first-year Carleton IMD student that studies Interactive Multimedia and Design at Carleton
                University. He spends most of his days playing video games and procrastinating his
                homework. He also always likes to make it known to his friends that he is filipino.</p>

        <h2 class="item homesubtitle2 hidden">More About Him</h2>
        <p class="item homeinfo3 hidden">Tristan is a relatively sarcastic and funny person, mostly unserious at all
            times,
            however, in some cases can be serious depending on the situation and context. He self-proclaims that his
            only
            personality trait is "Being Filipino". (Obviously his personality cannot be filipino)
            <a href="personalitys.html">Learn more about his PERSONALITY here.</a>
        </p>
        <p class="item homeinfo4 hidden">Tristan is very passionate about technology (specifically Computers and
            keyboards
            building), pop culture, and food. He often obsesses over various different media franchises and makes
            references to them, however, no one ever understands what he is talking.
