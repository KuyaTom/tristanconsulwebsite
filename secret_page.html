                This is regular Tristan. The whole website already talked about him. There isn't much else to say about
                him
                anymore.</p><br>
            <p>However, out of all the Tristans, he is the most socially awkward and least dripped out version. This is
                the version of Tristan that everyone of this universe sees and interacts with everyday.

            <p>
                This is Rapstan. He is the rapper version of Tristan.</p><br>
            <p>This version of Tristan has been seen wearing 2 different outfits (so far). The first one being his
                regular fit and teh second being his semi-formal fit. He is a wannabe member of the hood and he acts
                very ghetto. He is also very awful at rapping. See links below for proof.</p><br>

                This is The Dripster aka Dripstan. He is the dripped version of Tristan.
                anymore.</p><br>
            <p>Arguably the one of best fitted and dripped out version of Tristan. He's a lot more confident then
                regular Tristan and his level of charisma is completely off the charts.

                This is Darth Tristan. He is the Sith Lord version of Tristan.</p><br>
            <p>He's got black eyeliner splotches all over his face because he thinks that it makes him more scary. He is
                extremely skilled at lightsaber combat and is one of the sith lords of all time. Below is a video of him
                in action.</p><br>

            <p>
                This is Action Hero Tristan. He is the most skilled, tactical, and well-dressed version of Tristan. He
                is the second best dressed version, only second to the Dripster.</p><br>
            <p>This version of Tristan is trained in all combat styles and is the physical embodiment of what you
                imagine an action hero to be. He is the most epic and cool version of Tristan.</p><br>
            <p>You can watch the video link next to Darth Tristan to see him in action.

            <p>
                This is Chess Grandmaster Tristan. He is the version of Tristan that great at chess.</p><br>
            <p>Out of all the Tristans, this is the smartest and most logical one. His ability to calculate anything is
                faster than light itself.
                He has 100% win rate at chess and his IQ level surpasses Einstein. His only weakness is that he is awful
                at checkers.</p>

            <p>
                This is K-Pop Tristan. He's not actually a K-pop star, he just looks like one because of his ridiculous
                hair colour.</p><br>
            <p>He can sing though, but every other Tristan can sing, he just does it better. His dance moves also aren't
                too shabby.</p>

                This is Silent Tristan. He is without a doubt the most quiet version of Tristan.</p><br>
            <p>He wears a piece of duct tape on his face and he has sworn to a vow of silence. He communicates with
                others through a Text-to-Speech plugin on his phone's notepad app.</p>

            <p>This is Bully Tristan. He is meanest version of Tristan because he's a bully.</p><br>
            <p>He wear a very stereotypical bully outfit all the time and has face tatoos covering all over his face. He
                is canonically to only Tristan to have died (oh no, anyway). He was shot by a finger gun from regular
                Tristan by accident.</p><br>

            <p>
                This is the final variant of Tristan, known as the Manager of Time. He wears a Spongebob bucket hat.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This is the only version of Tristan that doesn't procrasinate and is actually great at managing his time
                properly. He is so good at managing his time that he managed to figure out how to travel throughout
                time, space, and other universes. He's like Doctor Who but instead of travelling inside of a TARDIS, he
                is the TARDIS.</p><br>
            <p>Below is a video of him helping Regular Tristan learn how to manage his time properly.</p><br>
